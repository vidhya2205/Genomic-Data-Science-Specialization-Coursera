# Algorithms-for-DNA-Sequencing-Coursera

This repository contains 4 jupyter notebooks that each contain the example algorithm as taught in the Coursera's course ["Algorithms for DNA Sequencing"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing?msockid=263c03b77fe161fb36cf104d7e47606b) followed by certain modifications that demonstrate my learnings.
